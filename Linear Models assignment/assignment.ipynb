        "6. How can you incorporate nonlinear relationships between your target/response/dependent/outcome variable $y$ and your features/control/response/independent variables $x$ into your analysis?\n",
        "7. What is the interpretation of the intercept? A slope coefficient for a variable? The coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable?"

        "1. A model is considered \"linear\" when it is linear in its parameters, meaning the model predicts the outcome as a weighted sum of the input features, where the weights (also called coefficients or parameters) appear in a linear way. This doesn't mean the relationship between the input variables and the outcome must form a straight line on a graph—instead, it means the model is structured so that each parameter multiplies a feature or transformed feature, and all those products are added together. For example, we can include squared or log-transformed variables in a linear model, and it would still be considered linear as long as the parameters themselves are not raised to a power, multiplied by each other, or placed inside non-linear functions. So when we say a model is “linear,” we specifically mean it is linear in the parameters used to estimate the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The coefficient for a dummy (or one-hot-encoded) variable in a linear model represents the average difference in the outcome between the group identified by that dummy and a baseline group—but this interpretation depends on the presence of the intercept. When we include an intercept in the model (which we usually do), one category from each categorical variable must be left out to avoid multicollinearity (a situation known as the \"dummy variable trap\"). The omitted category becomes the baseline, and the coefficient for each dummy variable tells us how much higher or lower the predicted outcome is for that group compared to the baseline group, holding all other variables constant. If we exclude the intercept, then all categories can be included, and each dummy coefficient reflects the average outcome for that group directly—but this setup is less common and usually less interpretable. So, the \"trick\" is that the interpretation of dummy variable coefficients hinges on whether or not the model includes an intercept.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Linear regression is not ideal for classification, but it can be used in very limited cases—though it’s generally not recommended. Classification involves predicting discrete class labels (like 0 or 1), whereas linear regression predicts continuous numeric values. If you try to use linear regression for a binary classification problem, you might fit a model that predicts values between 0 and 1, and then you can set a cutoff (like 0.5) to assign a class label. However, this approach has problems: the model can predict values outside the [0,1] range, it's sensitive to outliers, and it doesn't model class probabilities well. More importantly, linear regression doesn't optimize for classification accuracy—it minimizes squared error, not classification error. That’s why logistic regression (and other methods like decision trees or support vector machines) is preferred for classification tasks, because they’re specifically designed to handle categorical outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Signs that your linear model is overfitting include high performance on the training data but poor performance on the test or validation data. In other words, the model fits the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations rather than the true underlying pattern. You might see a very low training error but a much higher error when the model is applied to new data. Another sign is when the model has too many features, especially irrelevant ones, which can cause it to become too flexible and sensitive to minor variations. You might also notice unusually large or unstable coefficient estimates, indicating the model is trying too hard to fit every point.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more explanatory variables in a regression model are highly correlated, meaning they contain overlapping information about the outcome. This makes it hard for the model to estimate the effect of each variable separately, leading to unstable coefficient estimates and inflated standard errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand this using two-stage least squares (2SLS), imagine we're trying to estimate the effect of an explanatory variable X1 on outcome Y, but X1 is highly correlated with another variable X2. In 2SLS, the idea is to break this problematic correlation by using an instrumental variable (IV)—a new variable Z that is correlated with X1 but *not* directly with Y (except through X1).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first stage, we regress X1 on the instrument Z (and possibly other exogenous variables) to get a predicted version of X1 that’s uncorrelated with the noise or multicollinearity. In the second stage, we regress Y on this predicted version of X1 instead of the original. This helps isolate the variation in X1 that is clean and not entangled with X2, reducing the effects of multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. I can incorporate nonlinear relationships between your outcome variable y and your predictors x into your analysis while still using a linear model framework by transforming the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another approach is to use splines or piecewise linear functions, which allow the relationship to bend at certain points (called knots), creating flexible, smooth curves. I can also use polynomial regression, which includes higher-order terms like x^2, x^3 , etc., to capture curvature in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The intercept represents the predicted value of the outcome variable\n",
        "y when all the independent variables (features) are equal to zero. It acts as the baseline level of y, but it may not always be meaningful, especially if \"all variables equal zero\" isn’t realistic in the context of the data (e.g., zero income or age).\n",
        "\n",
        "A slope coefficient for a variable shows how much the outcome variable\n",
        "y is expected to change when that particular independent variable increases by one unit, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant. It reflects the marginal effect of that variable on the outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "The coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable tells us the average difference in the outcome between the group represented by the dummy and the baseline group (the category that was left out), again assuming other variables are held constant. This interpretation assumes the model includes an intercept—if it doesn't, the meaning of the dummy coefficients changes significantly.\n"

        "\n",
        "However, the slope being too small has consequences: it means our model underestimates the true effect of the variable X on the outcome Y, which can lead to worse predictions, especially when we care about how sensitiveY is to changes in X.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In this case, the noise ni is random, has an average of zero, and is unrelated to both the true values zi and the outcomes yi. That means the noise is just random measurement error, like what might happen due to careless data entry or imprecise tools, and it's not systematically pushing the data in any direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though the noise isn't biased and doesn't create a direct relationship with the outcome, it still causes problems by increasing the overall variance in the observed variable xi. Since the slope formula divides by the variance of x, this added noise in the denominator makes the slope smaller than it should be. So the estimated effect of the predictor on the outcome is weaker than it really is.\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuition is that the random noise makes it harder to detect the true relationship between the variables. It spreads out the x values in a meaningless way, which makes it look like changes in x have less of an effect on y, even when they actually do. The real signal is being hidden behind random clutter.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Attenuation directly affects how we think about the value of collecting higher-quality data. When there is measurement error in your features, your model underestimates the true relationships between variables. This means that even if there’s a real, strong effect of a variable on the outcome, your model might suggest it’s weak or even irrelevant—just because the data is noisy. In terms of cost-benefit, this suggests that there’s a real benefit to investing in better data collection or more careful data cleaning. By reducing noise in your features, you reduce attenuation, which helps your model capture the true relationships more accurately. This leads to better predictions and more reliable conclusions.\n"

While working through the notebook, I noticed that the model pipeline with preprocessing steps like one-hot encoding and feature scaling worked well and allowed for a clean, modular approach to training. Using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline helped keep the code organized and reproducible. However, one limitation was that the dataset had mostly numeric features with limited categorical data, which may have restricted the benefits of encoding. Additionally, I didn't explore other models beyond linear regression, so performance improvements might have been limited. If I had to do this again, I would spend more time exploring the data upfront to identify any interactions or non-linear relationships, consider feature engineering earlier, and try a variety of models such as decision trees or regularized regressions to compare performance more effectively."
