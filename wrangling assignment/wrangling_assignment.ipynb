Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing?\n",

        "After cleaning the categorical, I realized that there are a total of 9848 missing values out of a total of 12925 rows of data. So the proporation of missing values is 9848/12925 = 0.76 (rounding to 2 decimal places), which is 76%. The high proportion of missing values is a concern as the missing values could affect the validity of conclusions regarding police use of force and injury outcomes and it would also introduce bias.\n",

        "After cross-tabulating, according to the table generated, the inuries seem to be concentrated in categories like Gun Point Display, Firearm, and Police K9 Bite, where injuries might have been expected but are largely absent in the table. The fact that Bodily Force and Taser have a higher proportion of both \"Yes\" and \"No\" means they are more consistently reported compared to others. This missing data issue is concerning because it can bias any conclusions drawn about the relationship between force type and injuries."
