        "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing?\n",

        "After cleaning the categorical, I realized that there are a total of 9848 missing values out of a total of 12925 rows of data. So the proporation of missing values is 9848/12925 = 0.76 (rounding to 2 decimal places), which is 76%. The high proportion of missing values is a concern as the missing values could affect the validity of conclusions regarding police use of force and injury outcomes and it would also introduce bias.\n",

        "After cross-tabulating, according to the table generated, the inuries seem to be concentrated in categories like Gun Point Display, Firearm, and Police K9 Bite, where injuries might have been expected but are largely absent in the table. The fact that Bodily Force and Taser have a higher proportion of both \"Yes\" and \"No\" means they are more consistently reported compared to others. This missing data issue is concerning because it can bias any conclusions drawn about the relationship between force type and injuries."

Next, I addressed cases where SentenceTypeAllChargesAtConvictionInContactEvent had a value of 9, which indicates missing or unknown sentencing information, by setting the corresponding imposed sentence values to NaN. I then enforced logical consistency by ensuring that cases classified as probation (type 0) had an imposed sentence of 0 months, cases under jail (type 1) had sentences between 1 and 12 months, and cases under prison (type 2) had sentences of at least 12 months. Any records where the sentence type suggested dismissal, deferral, or pending status (type 4) were also set to NaN. Additionally, I rounded small floating-point values (e.g., 0.98 months) to the nearest whole number, assuming that sentences are recorded in full months."

        "1. This paper highlights an essential component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy data is structured in a straightforward manner, where each variable corresponds to a column, each observation occupies a row, and each type of observational unit is organized into a table. This structured approach streamlines the processing of messy datasets and facilitates the creation of efficient data analysis tools. The abstract defines data tidying, explains its benefits, and presents a case study illustrating its practical advantages.\n",

As a result, it simplifies the overall data analysis process.\n",

In contrast, messy datasets can be disorganized in many different ways, requiring unique cleaning approaches for each case. Tidy data establishes a consistent relationship between a dataset’s structure (its layout) and its semantics (its meaning), making analysis more straightforward. However, messy data can violate these principles in different ways, such as having column headers that represent values instead of variable names or storing multiple variables within a single column. This variation in disorganization is why each messy dataset requires a different cleaning strategy.\n",

        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem with tidy data refers to the idea that its usefulness is directly tied to the tools designed to work with it. This creates a cycle where tidy tools and tidy data become closely interconnected. If people adopt tidy data primarily because of tools like ggplot2 and dplyr, as mentioned in the article, then the concept might seem like just a way to promote these tools rather than a fundamental approach to data organization. However, Wickham envisions tidy data as more than just a framework tied to specific tools. He hopes it will influence the broader philosophy of data cleaning and organization. He acknowledges this by stating that while he does not see tidy data as the final solution, he hopes others will build upon it to develop even better data storage strategies and tools. This highlights his goal for tidy data to serve as an inspiration for new ideas, tools, and best practices in data science rather than being limited to existing software.\n",
